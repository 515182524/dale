# Privacy Policy – dale海关数据

Effective date: 2026-01-16

## Overview
This Privacy Policy applies to the Chrome browser extension “dale海关数据” (the “Extension”).

The Extension is designed to assist users in quickly querying publicly available business and customs-related information through external websites using browser context menu actions. The Extension operates primarily within the user’s browser environment.

## Information Collection
The Extension does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data, including but not limited to:
- Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other identifiers
- IP addresses
- Browsing history
- Location information
- Authentication credentials or financial information

Any text selected by the user is used **only locally** to construct search queries and is immediately passed to the destination website selected by the user.

## Data Usage
All operations performed by the Extension occur locally within the user’s browser.  
The Extension does not:
- Send data to its own servers
- Track users
- Perform analytics or behavioral profiling

## Permissions
The Extension requests only the minimum permissions necessary to provide its functionality:
- `contextMenus`: to provide right-click menu options for quick searches
- `activeTab`: to access the currently active page when triggered by the user
- `storage`: to store activation information locally within the browser

These permissions are used solely to enable the Extension’s core features.

## Third-Party Websites
When a user selects a menu option, the Extension may open third-party websites (such as search engines or public business databases) in a new browser tab.  
Any data processing performed on those websites is governed by their respective privacy policies. The Extension does not control or monitor third-party services.

## Data Retention
The Extension does not retain personal data.  
Activation-related information (if any) is stored locally on the user’s device and can be removed by uninstalling the Extension or clearing browser data.

## Children’s Privacy
The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
